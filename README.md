# CppScreepsBase
This repository is basic code to get setup running screeps using C++

This repository was inspired by https://github.com/screepers/cppreeps
and was created out of the ashes of my own effort to get that
repository working with enscripten and the screeps game in the current
times.

Easiest way to get started with this repository is to:

1. Install emscripten's latest: https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
2. run `make`
3. copy main.js loop.wasm loop_js.js wasm_loader.js into a screeps instance.
